Installation on SAP IDM 8.0

This documentation is specific to SAP IDM 8.0. If you intend to install on SAP
IDM 7.2, please refer to INSTALL72.txt.

Install Prerequisites

This connector internally uses the SAP Business Intelligence platform Java SDK,
a commercial software available to SAP customers on the SAP Service
Marketplace. Before installling the connector, plase download the SDK first. We
recommend you do not install the SDK directly on the SAP IDM runtime, but
instead install it on a separate machine or VM.

After installing the SDK, find the following JAR files and copy them over to
the SAP IDM runtime machine into a new directory, e.g. C:\IDM_BOBJ_LIBS:

  • aspectjrt.jar
  • bcm.jar
  • ceaspect.jar
  • cecore.jar
  • celib.jar
  • cesession.jar
  • corbaidl.jar
  • cryptojFIPS.jar
  • ebus405.jar
  • log4j.jar
  • logging.jar
  • TraceLog.jar

For the purposes of this connector, you don't need any other content included
in the SDK installation.

Add SDK JARs to IDM Classpath

On the SAP IDM runtime machine, start the Identity Management Dispatcher
Utility in GUI mode using the command dispatcherutil gui.

Open the Dispatcher Utility's settings dialog using Tools -> Settings. Add all
SDK JAR files listed above to the setting DSE Class Path. Use absolute paths,
and separate each JAR file's path from the next with one semicolon character
(;) on Windows, or one colon character (:) on Unix. After saving your changes,
regenerate dispatcher scripts and restart all dispatchers.

If you need to do edit the DSE class path without Identity Management
Dispatcher Utility, edit property DSECLASSPATH in the dispatcher service
property files directly. Keep in mind, though, that such manual changes will be
lost whenever dispatcher scripts are regenerated from the tool.

Install Connector

Perform the remaining steps on a machine with SAP IDM Developer Studio
installed:

 1. Unzip the content of idm-connector-bobj-<VERSION>.zip into a new directory,
    e.g. C:\IDM_BOBJ_INSTALL
 2. Use SAP IDM Developer Studio to import the connector package file
    de.foxysoft.bobj.idmpck from the above directory into your main Identity
    Store (SAP Master IDS).
 3. Use SAP IDM administration web UI (/idm/admin) to create a new repository
    of type SapBusinessObjects42
 4. Run job SAP BusinessObjects 4.2 - Initial Load from package
    de.foxysoft.bobj with the new repository. The job is created automatically
    with each new SapBusinessObjects42 repository.
