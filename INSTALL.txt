Installation on SAP IDM 8.0

The following installation instructions are specific to SAP IDM 8.0. If you
intend to install on SAP IDM 7.2, please refer to INSTALL72.txt.

Install Prerequisites

This connector internally uses the SAP Business Intelligence platform Java SDK,
a commercial software available to SAP customers on the SAP Service
Marketplace. Before installling the connector, plase download the SDK first. We
recommend you do not install the SDK directly on the SAP IDM runtime, but
instead install it on a separate machine or VM.

After installing the SDK, find the following JAR files and copy them over to
the SAP IDM runtime machine into a new directory, e.g. C:\IDM_BOBJ_LIBS:

  • aspectjrt.jar
  • bcm.jar
  • ceaspect.jar
  • cecore.jar
  • celib.jar
  • cesession.jar
  • corbaidl.jar
  • cryptojFIPS.jar
  • ebus405.jar
  • log4j.jar
  • logging.jar
  • TraceLog.jar

For the purposes of this connector, you don't need any other content included
in the SDK installation.

Add SDK JARs to IDM Classpath

On the SAP IDM runtime machine, start the Identity Management Dispatcher
Utility in GUI mode using the command dispatcherutil gui.

Open the Dispatcher Utility's settings dialog using Tools -> Settings. Add all
SDK JAR files listed above to the setting DSE Class Path. Make sure to specify
each class path entry as an absolute path, and separate individual class path
entries using your platform's separator character (semicolon for Windows, colon
for Unix).

After saving your changes, regenerate dispatcher scripts using Dispatcher ->
Regenerate Scripts and restart the dispatcher. If you have mutliple
dispatchers, repeat these two steps for all your dispatchers.

If your version of the Identity Management Dispatcher Utility doesn't support
editing the DSE class path, edit property DSECLASSPATH in the dispatcher
service property files directly. Keep in mind, though, that such manual changes
will be lost whenever dispatcher scripts are regenerated from the tool.

Install Connector

Perform the remaining steps on a machine with SAP IDM Developer Studio
installed:

 1. Unzip the content of idm-connector-bobj-<VERSION>.zip into a new directory,
    e.g. C:\IDM_BOBJ_INSTALL
 2. Use SAP IDM Developer Studio to import the connector package file
    de.foxysoft.bobj.idmpck into your main Identity Store (SAP Master IDS).
 3. Use the SAP IDM administration web UI (/idm/admin) to create a new
    repository of type SapBusinessObjects42
 4. Run the job SAP BusinessObjects 4.2 - Initial Load with this new repository
